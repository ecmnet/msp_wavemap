# Boost's system package exposes all headers through a single Boost::headers
# target. However, wavemap only needs Boost's Preprocessor component which we
# selectively pull in as Boost::preprocessor when using FetchContent. To allow
# targets to link against Boost::preprocessor regardless of which install mode
# is used, we define an alias from Boost::preprocessor to Boost::headers.
