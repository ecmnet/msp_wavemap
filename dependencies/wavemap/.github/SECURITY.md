# Security Policy

We currently do not expect wavemap to be exposed in security-sensitive contexts. If you intend to use wavemap in such a scenario, please contact victor.reijgwart@ethz-asl.ch so that we are aware and can discuss it.

We would be happy to merge security-related patches and assist with security-related improvements.
